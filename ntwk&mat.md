## Equations of Networks

A circuit with *b* branches and *n* nodes has *2b* unknowns (branch currents and branch voltages). We have *(n-1)* equations by KCL, *(b-n+1)* by KVL, and *b* from all components/devices (assuming two terminals), thus *2b* equations altogether.

### The Method of Branch Currents
If all branch voltages can be represented by branch currents based on equations of components/devices, the number of unknowns are reduced to *b* (branch currents), and the number of equations are reduced to *b* (*(n-1)* by KCL, and *(b-n+1)* by KVL).

### The Method of Nodal Voltages
Some node is designated as **ground**. The voltages between other nodes and the **ground** are called **nodal voltages**. Branch voltages are the differences between the corresponding nodal voltages. If all branch currents can be represented by branch voltages, and hence nodal voltages, based on equations of components/devices, the number of unknowns are reduced to *n-1* (nodal voltages), and the number of equations are reduced to *n-1*, by KCL.

## Matrices of Networks

### 关联矩阵、回路矩阵、割集矩阵
给一个网络的*n*个结点和*b*条之路编号。据此可以写出一个有*nb*个元素的矩阵**A**。*a<sub>jk</sub> = 1*表示支路*k*的参考方向背离结点*j*，*a<sub>jk</sub> = -1*表示指向，*a<sub>jk</sub> = 0*表示无关联。

## Two Port Networks

### Network Parameters
To find the network parameters (Z, Y, ABCD, S, etc.), use single excitation method, simultaneous excitation method, or solve the equations of the network.
